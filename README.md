# How To

## Requirements

* installed NodeJS version >= 0.12.xx
 * see https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/ for more information (e.g. how to install)

## Start

Just clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Devoxx4KidsDE/workshop-maze-vr.git
```

install all required dependencies

```
cd workshop-maze-vr
npm install
```

and once the dependencies are installed simply start the app with

```
npm start
```

The example maze now available at http://localhost:8080/app

This project uses [http-server](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server) to serve all required files.
Port 8080 is the default. However, you can set a custom port with the ``-p`` option.

```
npm start -- -p 8081
```


## Hack your maze

So how to create your own maze you may ask?

1. the simplest way would be to open `app/examples/example.js` and start hacking :-)
2. a second option would be to create a new file (e.g. `app/examples/myAwesomeMaze.js`) and to adjust `app/app.js` to load the correct file.

To learn how to create walls and portals please see the [presentation handout](https://github.com/Devoxx4KidsDE/workshop-maze-vr/blob/master/presentation/workshop-maze-vr_handout_ger.pdf).
